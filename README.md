## Project Description

This web project presents a curated selection of fashion designs likely featured in a "Fashion Week 2024" event. The project utilizes a grid-based layout (likely CSS Grid, as indicated by the file path in the screenshot) to display different scenes or modules of the portfolio.

The specific scene visible in the screenshot, "Mod.05 - Scene," suggests that the portfolio is organized into distinct sections, each focusing on a particular theme, style, or collection.

This project aims to provide a visually engaging and interactive experience for viewers to explore the showcased fashion designs.

## Features

* **Grid-Based Layout:** Employs a responsive grid system (likely CSS Grid) for organizing and displaying content.
* **Modular Design:** The portfolio is structured into modules or scenes (e.g., "Mod.05 - Scene") for easy navigation and organization.
* **Fashion Week 2024 Showcase:** Highlights designs from the "Fashion Week 2024" collection.
* **Navigation Menu:** Includes a navigation menu (visible in the screenshot) for navigating through different sections of the portfolio (Home, Portfolio, Fashion Week 2024, News/Articles, Contact).
* **Interactive Elements:** (This is speculative, but likely) May include interactive elements such as image galleries, modal pop-ups, or smooth scrolling.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For structuring the web page content.
* **CSS3:** For styling and layout, including CSS Grid for the grid-based layout.
* **JavaScript:** (Likely) For adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the page (e.g., menu functionality, image interactions).
* **Possibly:**
    * **CSS Frameworks:** (e.g., potentially Tailwind CSS or similar, though not explicitly visible)
    * **JavaScript Libraries:** (e.g., potentially for image galleries or other UI enhancements)
